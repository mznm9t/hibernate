                        The legacy (2.x) behavior of Hibernate in regards to JDBC connection management
                        was that a <code class="literal">Session</code> would obtain a connection when it was first
            needed and then hold unto that connection until the session was closed.
                        Hibernate 3.x introduced the notion of connection release modes to tell a session
                        how to handle its JDBC connections.  Note that the following discussion is pertinent
                        only to connections provided through a configured <code class="literal">ConnectionProvider</code>;
                        user-supplied connections are outside the breadth of this discussion.  The different
                        release modes are identified by the enumerated values of
                        <code class="literal">org.hibernate.ConnectionReleaseMode</code>:
                    
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc" compact>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         <code class="literal">ON_CLOSE</code> - is essentially the legacy behavior described above. The
                                         Hibernate session obtains a connection when it first needs to perform some JDBC access
                                         and holds unto that connection until the session is closed.

                                         <code class="literal">AFTER_TRANSACTION</code> - says to release connections after a
                                         <code class="literal">org.hibernate.Transaction</code> has completed.

                                         <code class="literal">AFTER_STATEMENT</code> (also referred to as aggressive release) - says to
                                         release connections after each and every statement execution. This aggressive releasing
                                         is skipped if that statement leaves open resources associated with the given session;
                                         currently the only situation where this occurs is through the use of
                                         <code class="literal">org.hibernate.ScrollableResults</code>.

         <p>
                        The configuration parameter <code class="literal">hibernate.connection.release_mode</code> is used
                        to specify which release mode to use.  The possible values:
                    
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc" compact>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         <code class="literal">auto</code> (the default) - this choice delegates to the release mode
                                         returned by the <code class="literal">org.hibernate.transaction.TransactionFactory.getDefaultReleaseMode()</code>
                                         method.  For JTATransactionFactory, this returns ConnectionReleaseMode.AFTER_STATEMENT; for
                                         JDBCTransactionFactory, this returns ConnectionReleaseMode.AFTER_TRANSACTION.  It is rarely
                                         a good idea to change this default behavior as failures due to the value of this setting
                                         tend to indicate bugs and/or invalid assumptions in user code.

                                         <code class="literal">on_close</code> - says to use ConnectionReleaseMode.ON_CLOSE.  This setting
                                         is left for backwards compatibility, but its use is highly discouraged.

                                         <code class="literal">after_transaction</code> - says to use ConnectionReleaseMode.AFTER_TRANSACTION.
                                         This setting should not be used in JTA environments.  Also note that with
                                         ConnectionReleaseMode.AFTER_TRANSACTION, if a session is considered to be in auto-commit
                                         mode connections will be released as if the release mode were AFTER_STATEMENT.
                                     
                  </p>

                                         <code class="literal">after_statement</code> - says to use ConnectionReleaseMode.AFTER_STATEMENT.  Additionally,
                                         the configured <code class="literal">ConnectionProvider</code> is consulted to see if it supports this
                                         setting (<code class="literal">supportsAggressiveRelease()</code>).  If not, the release mode is reset
                                         to ConnectionReleaseMode.AFTER_TRANSACTION.  This setting is only safe in environments where
                                         we can either re-acquire the same underlying JDBC connection each time we make a call into
                                         <code class="literal">ConnectionProvider.getConnection()</code> or in auto-commit environments where
                                         it does not matter whether we get back the same connection.
