            Hibernate queries can be quite powerful and complex. In fact, the power of the query language
            is one of Hibernate's main selling points. Here are some example queries very similar to queries
                that I used on a recent project. Note that most queries you will write are much simpler than these!
                    
         </p>
         <p>
                        The following query returns the order id, number of items and total value of the order for all
                        unpaid orders for a particular customer and given minimum total value, ordering the results by
                        total value. In determining the prices, it uses the current catalog. The resulting SQL query,
                        against the <code class="literal">ORDER</code>, <code class="literal">ORDER_LINE</code>, <code class="literal">PRODUCT</code>,
                        <code class="literal">CATALOG</code> and <code class="literal">PRICE</code> tables has four inner joins and an
                        (uncorrelated) subselect.
                    
         </p><pre class="programlisting">select order.id, sum(price.amount), count(item)
from Order as order
    join order.lineItems as item
    join item.product as product,
    Catalog as catalog
    join catalog.prices as price
where order.paid = false
    and order.customer = :customer
    and price.product = product
    and catalog.effectiveDate &lt; sysdate
    and catalog.effectiveDate &gt;= all (
        select cat.effectiveDate
        from Catalog as cat
        where cat.effectiveDate &lt; sysdate
    )
group by order
having sum(price.amount) &gt; :minAmount
order by sum(price.amount) desc</pre><p>
                        What a monster! Actually, in real life, I'm not very keen on subqueries, so my query was
                        really more like this:
                    
         </p><pre class="programlisting">select order.id, sum(price.amount), count(item)
from Order as order
    join order.lineItems as item
    join item.product as product,
    Catalog as catalog
    join catalog.prices as price
where order.paid = false
    and order.customer = :customer
    and price.product = product
    and catalog = :currentCatalog
group by order
having sum(price.amount) &gt; :minAmount
order by sum(price.amount) desc</pre><p>
                        The next query counts the number of payments in each status, excluding all payments in the
                        <code class="literal">AWAITING_APPROVAL</code> status where the most recent status change was made by the
                        current user. It translates to an SQL query with two inner joins and a correlated subselect
                        against the <code class="literal">PAYMENT</code>, <code class="literal">PAYMENT_STATUS</code> and
                        <code class="literal">PAYMENT_STATUS_CHANGE</code> tables.
                    
         </p><pre class="programlisting">select count(payment), status.name
from Payment as payment
    join payment.currentStatus as status
    join payment.statusChanges as statusChange
where payment.status.name &lt;&gt; PaymentStatus.AWAITING_APPROVAL
    or (
        statusChange.timeStamp = (
            select max(change.timeStamp)
            from PaymentStatusChange change
            where change.payment = payment
        )
        and statusChange.user &lt;&gt; :currentUser
    )
group by status.name, status.sortOrder
order by status.sortOrder</pre><p>
                        If I would have mapped the <code class="literal">statusChanges</code> collection as a list, instead of a set,
                        the query would have been much simpler to write.
                    
         </p><pre class="programlisting">select count(payment), status.name
from Payment as payment
    join payment.currentStatus as status
where payment.status.name &lt;&gt; PaymentStatus.AWAITING_APPROVAL
    or payment.statusChanges[ maxIndex(payment.statusChanges) ].user &lt;&gt; :currentUser
group by status.name, status.sortOrder
order by status.sortOrder</pre><p>
                        The next query uses the MS SQL Server <code class="literal">isNull()</code> function to return all
                        the accounts and unpaid payments for the organization to which the current user belongs.
                        It translates to an SQL query with three inner joins, an outer join and a subselect against
                        the <code class="literal">ACCOUNT</code>, <code class="literal">PAYMENT</code>, <code class="literal">PAYMENT_STATUS</code>,
                        <code class="literal">ACCOUNT_TYPE</code>, <code class="literal">ORGANIZATION</code> and
                        <code class="literal">ORG_USER</code> tables.
                    
         </p><pre class="programlisting">select account, payment
from Account as account
    left outer join account.payments as payment
where :currentUser in elements(account.holder.users)
    and PaymentStatus.UNPAID = isNull(payment.currentStatus.name, PaymentStatus.UNPAID)
order by account.type.sortOrder, account.accountNumber, payment.dueDate</pre><p>
                        For some databases, we would need to do away with the (correlated) subselect.
                    
         </p><pre class="programlisting">select account, payment
from Account as account
    join account.holder.users as user
    left outer join account.payments as payment
where :currentUser = user
    and PaymentStatus.UNPAID = isNull(payment.currentStatus.name, PaymentStatus.UNPAID)
order by account.type.sortOrder, account.accountNumber, payment.dueDate</pre></div>
