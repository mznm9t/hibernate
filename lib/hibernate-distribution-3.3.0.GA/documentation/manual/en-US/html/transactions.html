            The most important point about Hibernate and concurrency control is that it is very
            easy to understand. Hibernate directly uses JDBC connections and JTA resources without
            adding any additional locking behavior. We highly recommend you spend some time with the
                    JDBC, ANSI, and transaction isolation specification of your database management system.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                    Hibernate does not lock objects in memory. Your application can expect the behavior as
                    defined by the isolation level of your database transactions. Note that thanks to the
                    <code class="literal">Session</code>, which is also a transaction-scoped cache, Hibernate
                    provides repeatable reads for lookup by identifier and entity queries (not
                    reporting queries that return scalar values).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                    In addition to versioning for automatic optimistic concurrency control, Hibernate also
                    offers a (minor) API for pessimistic locking of rows, using the
                    <code class="literal">SELECT FOR UPDATE</code> syntax. Optimistic concurrency control and
                    this API are discussed later in this chapter.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                    We start the discussion of concurrency control in Hibernate with the granularity of
                    <code class="literal">Configuration</code>, <code class="literal">SessionFactory</code>, and
                    <code class="literal">Session</code>, as well as database transactions and long conversations.

            <p>
                           A <code class="literal">SessionFactory</code> is an expensive-to-create, threadsafe object 
                           intended to be shared by all application threads. It is created once, usually on
                           application startup, from a <code class="literal">Configuration</code> instance.
                       
            </p>
            <p>
                           A <code class="literal">Session</code> is an inexpensive, non-threadsafe object that should be
                           used once, for a single request, a conversation, single unit of work, and then discarded.
                           A <code class="literal">Session</code> will not obtain a JDBC <code class="literal">Connection</code>
                           (or a <code class="literal">Datasource</code>) unless it is needed, hence consume no
                           resources until used.
                       
            </p>
            <p>
                           To complete this picture you also have to think about database transactions. A
                           database transaction has to be as short as possible, to reduce lock contention in
                           the database. Long database transactions will prevent your application from scaling
                           to highly concurrent load. Hence, it is almost never good design to hold a
                           database transaction open during user think time, until the unit of work is
                           complete.
                       
            </p>
            <p>
                           What is the scope of a unit of work? Can a single Hibernate <code class="literal">Session</code>
                           span several database transactions or is this a one-to-one relationship of scopes? When
                           should you open and close a <code class="literal">Session</code> and how do you demarcate the
                           database transaction boundaries?

                                  First, don't use the <span class="emphasis"><em>session-per-operation</em></span> antipattern, that is,
                                  don't open and close a <code class="literal">Session</code> for every simple database call in
                                  a single thread! Of course, the same is true for database transactions. Database calls
                                  in an application are made using a planned sequence, they are grouped into atomic
                                  units of work. (Note that this also means that auto-commit after every single
                                  SQL statement is useless in an application, this mode is intended for ad-hoc SQL
                                  console work. Hibernate disables, or expects the application server to do so,
                                  auto-commit mode immediately.) Database transactions are never optional, all
                                  communication with a database has to occur inside a transaction, no matter if
                                  you read or write data. As explained, auto-commit behavior for reading data
                                  should be avoided, as many small transactions are unlikely to perform better than
                                  one clearly defined unit of work. The latter is also much more maintainable
                                  and extensible.
                              
               </p>
               <p>
                                  The most common pattern in a multi-user client/server application is
                                  <span class="emphasis"><em>session-per-request</em></span>. In this model, a request from the client
                                  is sent to the server (where the Hibernate persistence layer runs), a new Hibernate
                                  <code class="literal">Session</code> is opened, and all database operations are executed in this unit
                                  of work. Once the work has been completed (and the response for the client has been prepared),
                                  the session is flushed and closed. You would also use a single database transaction to
                                  serve the clients request, starting and committing it when you open and close the
                                  <code class="literal">Session</code>. The relationship between the two is one-to-one and this
                                  model is a perfect fit for many applications.
                              
               </p>
               <p>
                                  The challenge lies in the implementation. Hibernate provides built-in management of
                                  the "current session" to simplify this pattern. All you have to do is start a
                                  transaction when a server request has to be processed, and end the transaction
                                  before the response is sent to the client. You can do this in any way you
                                  like, common solutions are <code class="literal">ServletFilter</code>, AOP interceptor with a
                                  pointcut on the service methods, or a proxy/interception container. An EJB container
                                  is a standardized way to implement cross-cutting aspects such as transaction
                                  demarcation on EJB session beans, declaratively with CMT. If you decide to
                                  use programmatic transaction demarcation, prefer the Hibernate <code class="literal">Transaction</code>
                                  API shown later in this chapter, for ease of use and code portability.
                              
               </p>
               <p>
                                  Your application code can access a "current session" to process the request
                                  by simply calling <code class="literal">sessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</code> anywhere
                                  and as often as needed. You will always get a <code class="literal">Session</code> scoped
                                  to the current database transaction. This has to be configured for either
                                  resource-local or JTA environments, see <a href="architecture-current-session.html" title="2.5.&nbsp;Contextual Sessions">Section&nbsp;2.5, &#8220;Contextual Sessions&#8221;</a>.
                              
               </p>
               <p>
                                  Sometimes it is convenient to extend the scope of a <code class="literal">Session</code> and
                                  database transaction until the "view has been rendered". This is especially useful
                                  in servlet applications that utilize a separate rendering phase after the request
                                  has been processed. Extending the database transaction until view rendering is
                                  complete is easy to do if you implement your own interceptor. However, it is not
                                  easily doable if you rely on EJBs with container-managed transactions, as a
                                  transaction will be completed when an EJB method returns, before rendering of any
                                  view can start. See the Hibernate website and forum for tips and examples around
                                  this <span class="emphasis"><em>Open Session in View</em></span> pattern.

                                  The session-per-request pattern is not the only useful concept you can use to design
                                  units of work. Many business processes require a whole series of interactions with the user
                                  interleaved with database accesses. In web and enterprise applications it is
                                  not acceptable for a database transaction to span a user interaction. Consider the following
                                  example:
                              
               </p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul type="disc">
                     <li>
                        <p>
                                                   The first screen of a dialog opens, the data seen by the user has been loaded in
                                                   a particular <code class="literal">Session</code> and database transaction. The user is free to
                                                   modify the objects.
                                               
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>
                                                   The user clicks "Save" after 5 minutes and expects his modifications to be made
                                                   persistent; he also expects that he was the only person editing this information and
                                                   that no conflicting modification can occur.
                                               
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>
                                  We call this unit of work, from the point of view of the user, a long running
                                  <span class="emphasis"><em>conversation</em></span> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>application transaction</em></span>).
                                  There are many ways how you can implement this in your application.
                              
               </p>
               <p>
                                  A first naive implementation might keep the <code class="literal">Session</code> and database
                                  transaction open during user think time, with locks held in the database to prevent
                                  concurrent modification, and to guarantee isolation and atomicity. This is of course
                                  an anti-pattern, since lock contention would not allow the application to scale with
                                  the number of concurrent users.
                              
               </p>
               <p>
                                  Clearly, we have to use several database transactions to implement the conversation.
                                  In this case, maintaining isolation of business processes becomes the
                                  partial responsibility of the application tier. A single conversation
                                  usually spans several database transactions. It will be atomic if only one of
                                  these database transactions (the last one) stores the updated data, all others
                                  simply read data (e.g. in a wizard-style dialog spanning several request/response
                                  cycles). This is easier to implement than it might sound, especially if
                                  you use Hibernate's features:

                                  An application may concurrently access the same persistent state in two
                                  different <code class="literal">Session</code>s. However, an instance of a persistent class
                                  is never shared between two <code class="literal">Session</code> instances. Hence there are
                                  two different notions of identity:

               <p>
                                  Then for objects attached to a <span class="emphasis"><em>particular</em></span> <code class="literal">Session</code>
                                  (i.e. in the scope of a <code class="literal">Session</code>) the two notions are equivalent, and
                                  JVM identity for database identity is guaranteed by Hibernate. However, while the application
                                  might concurrently access the "same" (persistent identity) business object in two different
                                  sessions, the two instances will actually be "different" (JVM identity). Conflicts are
                                  resolved using (automatic versioning) at flush/commit time, using an optimistic approach.
                              
               </p>
               <p>
                                  This approach leaves Hibernate and the database to worry about concurrency; it also provides
                                  the best scalability, since guaranteeing identity in single-threaded units of work only doesn't
                                  need expensive locking or other means of synchronization. The application never needs to
                                  synchronize on any business object, as long as it sticks to a single thread per
                                  <code class="literal">Session</code>. Within a <code class="literal">Session</code> the  application may safely use
                                  <code class="literal">==</code> to compare objects.
                              
               </p>
               <p>
                                  However, an application that uses <code class="literal">==</code> outside of a <code class="literal">Session</code>,
                                  might see unexpected results. This might occur even in some unexpected places, for example,
                                  if you put two detached instances into the same <code class="literal">Set</code>. Both might have the same
                                  database identity (i.e. they represent the same row), but JVM identity is by definition not
                                  guaranteed for instances in detached state. The developer has to override the <code class="literal">equals()</code>
                                  and <code class="literal">hashCode()</code> methods in persistent classes and implement
                                  his own notion of object equality. There is one caveat: Never use the database
                                  identifier to implement equality, use a business key, a combination of unique, usually
                                  immutable, attributes. The database identifier will change if a transient object is made
                                  persistent. If the transient instance (usually together with detached instances) is held in a
                                  <code class="literal">Set</code>, changing the hashcode breaks the contract of the <code class="literal">Set</code>.
                                  Attributes for business keys don't have to be as stable as database primary keys, you only
                                  have to guarantee stability as long as the objects are in the same <code class="literal">Set</code>. See
                                  the Hibernate website for a more thorough discussion of this issue. Also note that this is not
                                  a Hibernate issue, but simply how Java object identity and equality has to be implemented.

                                                   An exception thrown by Hibernate means you have to rollback your database transaction
                                                   and close the <code class="literal">Session</code> immediately (discussed later in more detail).
                                                   If your <code class="literal">Session</code> is bound to the application, you have to stop
                                                   the application. Rolling back the database transaction doesn't put your business
                                                   objects back into the state they were at the start of the transaction. This means the
                                                   database state and the business objects do get out of sync. Usually this is not a
                                                   problem, because exceptions are not recoverable and you have to start over after
                                                   rollback anyway.

                                                   The <code class="literal">Session</code> caches every object that is in persistent state (watched
                                                   and checked for dirty state by Hibernate). This means it grows endlessly until you
                                                   get an OutOfMemoryException, if you keep it open for a long time or simply load too

                                                   to manage the <code class="literal">Session</code> cache, but you most likely should consider a
                                                   Stored Procedure if you need mass data operations. Some solutions are shown in
