            We've already spent quite some time talking about collections.
                        In this section we will highlight a couple more issues about
                        how collections behave at runtime.

            <p>Hibernate defines three basic kinds of collections:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul type="disc">
                  <li>
                     <p>collections of values</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>one to many associations</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>many to many associations</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                             This classification distinguishes the various table and foreign key
                               relationships but does not tell us quite everything we need to know
                               about the relational model. To fully understand the relational structure
                               and performance characteristics, we must also consider the structure of
                               the primary key that is used by Hibernate to update or delete collection
                               rows. This suggests the following classification:
                           
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul type="disc">
                  <li>
                     <p>indexed collections</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>sets</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>bags</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                               All indexed collections (maps, lists, arrays) have a primary key consisting
                               of the <code class="literal">&lt;key&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;index&gt;</code>
                               columns. In this case collection updates are usually extremely efficient -
                               the primary key may be efficiently indexed and a particular row may be efficiently
                               located when Hibernate tries to update or delete it.
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               Sets have a primary key consisting of <code class="literal">&lt;key&gt;</code> and element
                               columns. This may be less efficient for some types of collection element, particularly
                               composite elements or large text or binary fields; the database may not be able to index
                               a complex primary key as efficiently.  On the other hand, for one to many or many to many
                               associations, particularly in the case of synthetic identifiers, it is likely to be just
                               as efficient. (Side-note: if you want <code class="literal">SchemaExport</code> to actually create
                               the primary key of a <code class="literal">&lt;set&gt;</code> for you, you must declare all columns
                               as <code class="literal">not-null="true"</code>.)
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               <code class="literal">&lt;idbag&gt;</code> mappings define a surrogate key, so they are
                               always very efficient to update. In fact, they are the best case.
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               Bags are the worst case. Since a bag permits duplicate element values and has no
                               index column, no primary key may be defined. Hibernate has no way of distinguishing
                               between duplicate rows. Hibernate resolves this problem by completely removing
                               (in a single <code class="literal">DELETE</code>) and recreating the collection whenever it
                               changes. This might be very inefficient.
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               Note that for a one-to-many association, the "primary key" may not be the physical
                               primary key of the database table - but even in this case, the above classification
                               is still useful. (It still reflects how Hibernate "locates" individual rows of the
                               collection.)

            </div>
            <p>
                               From the discussion above, it should be clear that indexed collections
                               and (usually) sets allow the most efficient operation in terms of adding,
                               removing and updating elements.
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               There is, arguably, one more advantage that indexed collections have over sets for
                               many to many associations or collections of values. Because of the structure of a
                               <code class="literal">Set</code>, Hibernate doesn't ever <code class="literal">UPDATE</code> a row when
                               an element is "changed". Changes to a <code class="literal">Set</code> always work via
                               <code class="literal">INSERT</code> and <code class="literal">DELETE</code> (of individual rows). Once
                               again, this consideration does not apply to one to many associations.
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               After observing that arrays cannot be lazy, we would conclude that lists, maps and 
                               idbags are the most performant (non-inverse) collection types, with sets not far 
                               behind. Sets are expected to be the most common kind of collection in Hibernate 
                               applications. This is because the "set" semantics are most natural in the relational
                               model.
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               However, in well-designed Hibernate domain models, we usually see that most collections
                               are in fact one-to-many associations with <code class="literal">inverse="true"</code>. For these
                               associations, the update is handled by the many-to-one end of the association, and so
                               considerations of collection update performance simply do not apply.
                           
            </p>

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                               Just before you ditch bags forever, there is a particular case in which bags (and also lists)
                               are much more performant than sets. For a collection with <code class="literal">inverse="true"</code>
                               (the standard bidirectional one-to-many relationship idiom, for example) we can add elements
                               to a bag or list without needing to initialize (fetch) the bag elements! This is because
                               <code class="literal">Collection.add()</code> or <code class="literal">Collection.addAll()</code> must always
                               return true for a bag or <code class="literal">List</code> (unlike a <code class="literal">Set</code>). This can
                               make the following common code much faster.

Child c = new Child();
c.setParent(p);
p.getChildren().add(c);  //no need to fetch the collection!

            <p>
                               Occasionally, deleting collection elements one by one can be extremely inefficient. Hibernate
                               isn't completely stupid, so it knows not to do that in the case of an newly-empty collection
                               (if you called <code class="literal">list.clear()</code>, for example). In this case, Hibernate will
                               issue a single <code class="literal">DELETE</code> and we are done!
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               Suppose we add a single element to a collection of size twenty and then remove two elements.
                               Hibernate will issue one <code class="literal">INSERT</code> statement and two <code class="literal">DELETE</code>
                               statements (unless the collection is a bag). This is certainly desirable.
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               However, suppose that we remove eighteen elements, leaving two and then add thee new elements.
                               There are two possible ways to proceed
                           
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul type="disc">
                  <li>
                     <p>delete eighteen rows one by one and then insert three rows</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>remove the whole collection (in one SQL <code class="literal">DELETE</code>) and insert
                                        all five current elements (one by one)
                     </p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                               Hibernate isn't smart enough to know that the second option is probably quicker in this case.
                               (And it would probably be undesirable for Hibernate to be that smart; such behaviour might
                               confuse database triggers, etc.)
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               Fortunately, you can force this behaviour (ie. the second strategy) at any time by discarding
                               (ie. dereferencing) the original collection and returning a newly instantiated collection with
                               all the current elements. This can be very useful and powerful from time to time.
                           
            </p>
            <p>
                               Of course, one-shot-delete does not apply to collections mapped <code class="literal">inverse="true"</code>.
