            It is quite cumbersome to save, delete, or reattach individual objects,
            especially if you deal with a graph of associated objects. A common case is
                        a parent/child relationship. Consider the following example:
                    
         </p>
         <p>
            If the children in a parent/child relationship would be value typed (e.g. a collection
            of addresses or strings), their life cycle would depend on the parent and no
            further action would be required for convenient "cascading" of state changes.
            When the parent is saved, the value-typed child objects are saved as
                        well, when the parent is deleted, the children will be deleted, etc. This
                        even works for operations such as the removal of a child from the collection;
                        Hibernate will detect this and, since value-typed objects can't have shared
                        references, delete the child from the database.
                    
         </p>
         <p>
                        Now consider the same scenario with parent and child objects being entities,
                        not value-types (e.g. categories and items, or parent and child cats). Entities
                        have their own life cycle, support shared references (so removing an entity from
                        the collection does not mean it can be deleted), and there is by default no
                        cascading of state from one entity to any other associated entities. Hibernate
                        does not implement <span class="emphasis"><em>persistence by reachability</em></span> by default.
                    
         </p>
         <p>
                        For each basic operation of the Hibernate session - including <code class="literal">persist(), merge(),
                           saveOrUpdate(), delete(), lock(), refresh(), evict(), replicate()</code> - there is a 
                        corresponding cascade style. Respectively, the cascade styles are named <code class="literal">create, 
                           merge, save-update, delete, lock, refresh, evict, replicate</code>. If you want an 
                        operation to be cascaded along an association, you must indicate that in the mapping
                        document. For example:
                    
         </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;one-to-one name="person" cascade="persist"/&gt;</pre><p>
                        Cascade styles my be combined:
                    
         </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;one-to-one name="person" cascade="persist,delete,lock"/&gt;</pre><p>
                        You may even use <code class="literal">cascade="all"</code> to specify that <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
                        operations should be cascaded along the association. The default <code class="literal">cascade="none"</code>
                        specifies that no operations are to be cascaded.
                    
         </p>
         <p>
                        A special cascade style, <code class="literal">delete-orphan</code>, applies only to one-to-many
                        associations, and indicates that the <code class="literal">delete()</code> operation should
                        be applied to any child object that is removed from the association.
                    
         </p>
         <p>
                        Recommendations:
                    
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc" compact>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         It doesn't usually make sense to enable cascade on a <code class="literal">&lt;many-to-one&gt;</code>
                                         or <code class="literal">&lt;many-to-many&gt;</code> association. Cascade is often useful for 
                                         <code class="literal">&lt;one-to-one&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;one-to-many&gt;</code>
                                         associations.
                                     
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         If the child object's lifespan is bounded by the lifespan of the parent
                                         object, make it a <span class="emphasis"><em>life cycle object</em></span> by specifying
                                         <code class="literal">cascade="all,delete-orphan"</code>.
                                     
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         Otherwise, you might not need cascade at all. But if you think that you will often be
                                         working with the parent and children together in the same transaction, and you want to save 
                                         yourself some typing, consider using <code class="literal">cascade="persist,merge,save-update"</code>.
                                     
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>
                        Mapping an association (either a single valued association, or a collection) with 
                        <code class="literal">cascade="all"</code> marks the association as a 
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>parent/child</em></span> style relationship where save/update/delete of the 
                        parent results in save/update/delete of the child or children.
                    
         </p>
         <p>
                        Futhermore, a mere reference to a child from a persistent parent will result in 
                        save/update of the child. This metaphor is incomplete, however. A child which becomes 
                        unreferenced by its parent is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> automatically deleted, except 
                        in the case of a <code class="literal">&lt;one-to-many&gt;</code> association mapped with
                        <code class="literal">cascade="delete-orphan"</code>. The precise semantics of cascading 
                        operations for a parent/child relationship are as follows:
                    
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc" compact>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         If a parent is passed to <code class="literal">persist()</code>, all children are passed to 
                                         <code class="literal">persist()</code>
                                     
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         If a parent is passed to <code class="literal">merge()</code>, all children are passed to 
                                         <code class="literal">merge()</code>
                                     
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         If a parent is passed to <code class="literal">save()</code>, <code class="literal">update()</code> or 
                                         <code class="literal">saveOrUpdate()</code>, all children are passed to <code class="literal">saveOrUpdate()</code>
                                     
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         If a transient or detached child becomes referenced by a persistent parent, 
                                         it is passed to <code class="literal">saveOrUpdate()</code>
                                     
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         If a parent is deleted, all children are passed to <code class="literal">delete()</code>
                                     
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                                         If a child is dereferenced by a persistent parent, <span class="emphasis"><em>nothing
                                               special happens</em></span> - the application should explicitly delete 
                                         the child if necessary - unless <code class="literal">cascade="delete-orphan"</code>, 
                                         in which case the "orphaned" child is deleted.
                                     
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>
                        Finally, note that cascading of operations can be applied to an object graph at
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>call time</em></span> or at <span class="emphasis"><em>flush time</em></span>. All operations,
                        if enabled, are cascaded to associated entities reachable when the operation is
                        executed. However, <code class="literal">save-upate</code> and <code class="literal">delete-orphan</code>
                        are transitive for all associated entities reachable during flush of the
                        <code class="literal">Session</code>.
