msgid "Most applications using Hibernate need some form of \"contextual\" sessions, where a given session is in effect throughout the scope of a given context. However, across applications the definition of what constitutes a context is typically different; and different contexts define different scopes to the notion of current. Applications using Hibernate prior to version 3.0 tended to utilize either home-grown <literal>ThreadLocal</literal>-based contextual sessions, helper classes such as <literal>HibernateUtil</literal>, or utilized third-party frameworks (such as Spring or Pico) which provided proxy/interception-based contextual sessions."

msgid "Starting with version 3.0.1, Hibernate added the <literal>SessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</literal> method. Initially, this assumed usage of <literal>JTA</literal> transactions, where the <literal>JTA</literal> transaction defined both the scope and context of a current session. The Hibernate team maintains that, given the maturity of the numerous stand-alone <literal>JTA TransactionManager</literal> implementations out there, most (if not all) applications should be using <literal>JTA</literal> transaction management whether or not they are deployed into a <literal>J2EE</literal> container. Based on that, the <literal>JTA</literal>-based contextual sessions is all you should ever need to use."

msgid "The first two implementations provide a \"one session - one database transaction\" programming model, also known and used as <emphasis>session-per-request</emphasis>. The beginning and end of a Hibernate session is defined by the duration of a database transaction. If you use programmatic transaction demarcation in plain JSE without JTA, you are advised to use the Hibernate <literal>Transaction</literal> API to hide the underlying transaction system from your code. If you use JTA, use the JTA interfaces to demarcate transactions. If you execute in an EJB container that supports CMT, transaction boundaries are defined declaratively and you don't need any transaction or session demarcation operations in your code. Refer to <xref linkend=\"transactions\"/> for more information and code examples."

Note that for backwards compatibility, if this config param is not set but a <literal>org.hibernate.transaction.TransactionManagerLookup</literal> is configured, Hibernate will use the <literal>org.hibernate.context.JTASessionContext</literal>. Typically, the value of this parameter would just name the implementation class to use; for the three out-of-the-box implementations, however, there are three corresponding short names, \"jta\", \"thread\", and \"managed\"."
